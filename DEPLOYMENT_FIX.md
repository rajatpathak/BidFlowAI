# ðŸš¨ URGENT PRODUCTION FIX

## Problem
Your VPS deployment is returning HTML instead of JSON for API calls, causing the error:
```
Error: Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON
```

## Root Cause
The production server is serving static HTML files before API routes are processed.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Created Production Server (`server/production.js`)
- API routes registered BEFORE static file serving
- Explicit JSON content-type headers for all `/api/*` routes
- Proper error handling with JSON responses

### 2. Updated Deployment Process
Replace your `.github/workflows/bidflowai.yml` with the content from `deployment-fix.yml`

Key changes:
```bash
# In the deploy step, now uses:
pm2 start server/production.js --name BidFlowAI --env production
# Instead of:
pm2 restart BidFlowAI
```

### 3. Manual Fix (If You Can't Wait for GitHub Actions)

SSH into your VPS and run:

```bash
cd /var/www/html/BidFlowAI

# Stop current process
pm2 delete BidFlowAI

# Start with production server
pm2 start server/production.js --name BidFlowAI --env production
pm2 save

# Test API
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

### 4. Verification

After deployment, test these endpoints:
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Should return JSON with token
- `GET /api/dashboard/stats` - Should return JSON statistics
- `GET /api/tenders` - Should return JSON tender list

All should return proper JSON responses, not HTML.

### 5. Environment Variables

Ensure your VPS has:
- `DATABASE_URL` - Your PostgreSQL connection string
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `PORT=3000` (or your preferred port)

## Expected Result

After this fix:
âœ… API endpoints return JSON (not HTML)
âœ… Authentication works properly
âœ… Dashboard loads with real data
âœ… No more "Unexpected token" errors

The production server now ensures API routes are handled before static file serving, preventing HTML responses for API calls.

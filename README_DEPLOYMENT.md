# ðŸš€ BMS - Ready for Production Deployment

## Quick Deployment Fix

âœ… **FIXED**: The deployment error has been resolved.

**Problem**: Deployment failed because run command contained 'dev' (blocked for security)
**Solution**: Production-ready deployment scripts created

## How to Deploy Now

### In Replit Deployment Settings:

**Run Command**: `node replit-deployment.js`

This command will:
- Build the application for production
- Set up the database
- Start the production server
- Handle all security configurations

### Alternative Commands (if needed):

1. **Manual build + start**: `npm run build && npm start`
2. **Setup script**: `bash setup-production.sh && node dist/index.js`

## Environment Variables Needed

The following environment variables should be set in your deployment:
- `NODE_ENV=production` (auto-set by scripts)
- `PORT=5000` (auto-set by scripts)
- `DATABASE_URL` (if using database)
- Any API keys your app requires

## Verification

After deployment, check:
- Main app: `https://your-app.replit.app/`
- Health check: `https://your-app.replit.app/health`

Your BMS application is now ready for production deployment! ðŸŽ‰

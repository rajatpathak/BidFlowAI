The Bid Document Auto-Creation System 
It integrates a centralized document repository, AI-driven automation, and a manual editing interface to help users efficiently prepare submission-ready bid packages. Below are the key features and technical considerations.

1. Centralized Document Repository





Purpose: Store and manage company documents securely for use in bid preparation.



Features:





Cloud-based storage with support for PDFs and other file formats.



Searchable and browsable document library.



Role-based access control for security.



Technical Considerations:





Use cloud storage solutions (e.g., AWS S3).



Implement metadata tagging for efficient search.

2. RFP Upload Interface





Purpose: Enable users to upload RFP (Request for Proposal) documents for processing.



Features:





Upload multiple PDF files.



Optional OCR for scanned documents.



Upload progress feedback.



Technical Considerations:





Validate file formats and handle large uploads efficiently.

3. Specification of Required Documents





Purpose: Allow users to define the types of documents needed for the bid.



Features:





Checklist for standard document types (e.g., Pre-Qualification, QCBS, BOQ).



Option to add custom document types.



Technical Considerations:





Dynamic UI elements for document selection.

4. AI-Powered Auto-Filling of Annexures





Purpose: Automate the population of bid documents using RFP and company data.



Features:





AI extracts key details from RFPs (e.g., specifications, deadlines).



Matches data to company documents and fills annexures.



Handles standard bid sections (e.g., technical details, pricing).



Technical Considerations:





Integrate NLP-capable AI services (e.g., OpenAI GPT, AWS Comprehend).



Develop mapping logic for bid templates.

5. HTML Editor for Pending Documents





Purpose: Provide a manual editing interface for incomplete or custom documents.



Features:





WYSIWYG editor for text formatting, images, and tables.



File upload and real-time preview capabilities.



Technical Considerations:





Use libraries like TinyMCE or Quill for editing functionality.



Ensure input sanitization for security.

6. Generation of Final Bid Documents





Purpose: Compile all documents into a polished, submission-ready package.



Features:





Generate a single PDF or zip file with multiple PDFs.



Add standard elements (e.g., cover page, table of contents).



Review and approval step before final output.



Technical Considerations:





Use pdf-lib or Puppeteer for PDF creation and merging.

Additional Considerations





Security: Implement authentication, authorization, and encryption.



UI Framework: Build with React and Tailwind CSS for a responsive interface.



Scalability: Support multiple users and large document volumes.
